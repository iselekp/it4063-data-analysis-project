Researching and analyzing a topic for the UC IT4063 course.

Topic: Access to clean drinking water. Peopleâ€™s access to water impacts how they live and their quality of life. Understanding the factors that affect water quality and access can aid the development of safe water management strategies. 

Project Questions:
What factors affect access to clean drinking water?
Climate e.g. aridity?
Geography e.g. mountainous?
GDP?
Industrial activity?
What are the impacts of access to clean drinking water?
Decreased mortality rates?
Better productivity (GDP)?

What would an answer look like?
Show correlation between factors and drinking water quality.
For example, a scatter plot could show that as industrial activities approach well sources, the quality of drinking water decreases.
